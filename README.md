# Assimilation

## General Objectives
* Get comfortable working with ICESat-2 and DEM raster data in Python  
* Compare ICESat-2 data with various DEM raster data types (SAR, Lidar, Photogrammetry)
* Quantify errors when adjusting existing DEMs with ICESat-2 data over bare ground  
* Compare results from mid-latitude glaciers and polar glaciers  
* Use info in existing DEMs to interpolate/extrapolate between ICESat-2 points
